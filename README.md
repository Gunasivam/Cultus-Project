# 🧠 Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Deep Learning (Seq2Seq + Attention)  
**Single-Cell Jupyter Notebook Project**

This repository contains an **end-to-end time series forecasting project** built using **Deep Learning (LSTM Encoder–Decoder)** with a simplified **Attention mechanism**, along with **baseline classical models** for comparison.

The entire project is implemented in **one single Jupyter cell**, making it lightweight, beginner-friendly, and ideal for GitHub portfolio projects.
